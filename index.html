        <p class="mb-2">The School Adoption Program (SAP) is one of the six education projects in Nirmaan. SAP aims to improve the learning environment of government schools by providing resources, infrastructure upgrades, and to enhance the overall education standard. Our ultimate goal is to provide enough comprehensive support to the schools so that they can eventually become self-reliant and sustain the improvements on their own.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>The primary school previously hosted mid-day meals in the open. In response to the challenges posed by harsh weather conditions, SAP successfully constructed a shed to provide a safe and comfortable space for the children to enjoy their meals.</li>

        volunteers and project members who have selflessly devoted
        their time and energy to uplifting our beneficiaries, becoming
        catalysts for transformative social change. Moreover, we
        express heartfelt thanks to our esteemed alumni, whose
        unwavering support has propelled our ideas from mere
        concepts to tangible realities. We also want to express our
        deep appreciation to the BITS community for their steadfast
        support and encouragement. It is through the collective efforts
        and unwavering commitment of each individual involved that
        we have been able to create a lasting, positive difference.
