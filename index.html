          <p class="text-gray-700">Joy of Giving Week is Nirmaan's initiative to unite BITSians in the spirit of 'giving' and the joy that emanates from it, both for the giver and the receiver. Nirmaan organized a series of events over the course of a week (from February 19th, 2024, to February 25th, 2024) to encourage people to share love and joy with those around them. The following events were conducted: <strong>Inauguration:</strong>The inauguration of JOGW, held in the NAB auditorium, was graced by the presence of Vice Chancellor, Director along with other faculty. <br><strong>Garden of Queens:</strong>This day honored the women beneficiaries of Nirmaan with an inspirational documentary, games, refreshments, and mementos.<br>
          <strong>Likhe Joh Khat Tujhe:</strong>Anonymous Message booths at campus eateries were set up. This event was a huge success as thousands of letters were delivered to the recipients' hostel rooms.
          <br> <strong>Ek Shaam Apke Naam:</strong>Nirmaan distributed food to mess workers and provided tea to night guards on campus. This gesture appreciated and acknowledged their hard work and contribution to the community.<br>
